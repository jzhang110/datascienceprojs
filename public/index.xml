      <description>Python is a versatile programming language that can be used in many ways. Although my journey through python had just started, I’ve noticed little things that I can do through python that may be very useful to me in the future. For example, using the findall() function from the re module, I can match certain numbers that I desire from a string and print them all out. This function is useful when extraction of certain information is desired, such as IP addresses.</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 3/8/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).
The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 5/1/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
