      <description>I discovered my interest in software as I progressed through college. I began to find myself pursuing varying personal projects to enrich my knowledge in the field. These projects had brought me much joy and I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering. I like to live a life full of adventure and will always be interested to learn new things and to explore new career opportunities.</description>
